        Privacy Policy
      </h1>
            <br>
            <p>Apply for a direct payment of rent allows landlords to request that part of their tenant’s Universal Credit payment is paid directly to them to cover the cost of the rent or rent arrears.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">
The Data Protection Act
        </h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions" class="govuk-link">Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)</a> is the Data Controller for Apply for a Direct Rent Payment for the purposes of the Data Protection Act. A data controller determines how and why personal data can be processed.</p>
            <p>Our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions/about/personal-information-charter" class="govuk-link">personal information charter</a> explains:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>how we collect and use personal information</li>
                <li>how to ask for a copy of the information we hold about you</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">
What data we collect from you
        </h2>
            <p>The personal data we collect from you includes:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>your name</li>
                <li>details about the property</li>
                <li>contact information</li>
                <li>bank details</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will also ask you to provide some personal data about your tenant, such as their name, address and why you have requested a direct rent payment.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">
What we do with your data
        </h2>
            <p>The data we collect from you helps us identify if the application is valid. If the application is successful, we use the personal data you’ve provided to arrange a direct rent payment or repayment of rent arrears from your tenant’s Universal Credit payment.</p>
            <p>We will not:</p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>sell or rent your data to third parties</li>
                <li>share your data with third parties for marketing purposes</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We will share your data if we’re required to do so by law – for example, by court order, or to prevent fraud or other crime.</p>
            <h2 class="heading-medium">
How long we keep your data

        </h2>
            <p>We will only keep your personal data for as long as:
            </p>
            <ul class="list list-bullet">
                <li>the law requires us to</li>
                <li>we need for the purposes listed above</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This means that we will only hold your personal data for as long as the direct rent payment is in place and for 6 years after the payments have stopped.</p>
            <!-- <p>You can also <a href="/onlineform_v4/postcode-entry.html">apply by post</a>, but it will take longer to process your application.</p>
            <p>The online service is also available in <a href="#">Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">
Where your data is processed and stored        </h2>
            <p>We design, build and run our systems to make sure that your data is as safe as possible at any stage, both while it’s processed and when it’s stored.</p>
            <p>All personal data on Apply for a Direct Rent Payment is processed, stored and managed entirely in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/eu-eea" class="govuk-link">European Economic Area (EEA)</a>, and will not be transferred outside of it. This means that it is covered by EU Data Protection regulations.
